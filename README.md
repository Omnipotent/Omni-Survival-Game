The Omni Survival Game
-------------------------

Third-person survival game for Unreal Engine 4 made in C++. It currently features weapons and weapon pickups, explosives, zombie AI, multiplayer networking, an accurate day/night time system, a way to use props as barricades, and more. 

The current plan for this project is to: 

- Fix bugs and update any outdated code
- Remove any possible exploits (prop surfing, leaving the map, and etc:)
- Add more maps to increase replayability
- Add more AI monsters to increase enemy diversity and increase difficulty
- Overhaul the AI into performing much better and properly detecting the player in difficult situations
- Implement an options page that allows people with slower devices to play with reasonable framerates
- Create goals and tasks for the player(s) to complete
- Plus a few more things that I have not yet decided on ;D

*The original framework for this project was designed by Tom Looman as a 6 section tutorial series. For more info on the original, see [the main documentation page on the unreal engine Wiki](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Survival_sample_game).*
